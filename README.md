### Major Update for v0.3.x

I'm glad to send you a major update of this Library !

In April 5th, In AtCoder, the judge system update was tested and we found it will apply in very sooner.
**Rust** version update from `1.15.0` into `1.42.0`.
So, we can use a recent feature of Rust and useful and essential crate.
Also, this Library uses a lot of Rust feature of `edition 2018`.
Because of this, we cannot copy-paste this code to submit files without via binary.
These restrictions has made me troublesome. But new judge system is further comfortable for **Rust** AtCoder users.
Thanks to Language Update contributor.

As celebrating of this, I have released the new versoin of `prcn_lib` !

Most change from this version is

- More rich data-structure
- Re-export of crates following to AtCoder environment

We will trying to improve this Library more efficient and useful.
Please following!
